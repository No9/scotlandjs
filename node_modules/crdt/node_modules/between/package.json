Now the list is A, B, C, D.\n\nSeems like a funny way to track the position of elements right?\n\nThis method has a very important property: it is commutative.\nconcurrent inserts behave nicely, because inserting between two \nitems does not change the positions of nodes later in the list!\n\n## API\n\n### between(a, b)\n\n``` js\n\nvar b  = require('between')\nvar tween = b.between('a', 'b')\n\n//tween is a string that will sort between 'a' and 'b'.\n\n\n```\n\n`a` and `b` can be any string that does not end in the lowest character.\nthis is like how there is only one number between 0 and 1 that ends in a \"0\".\n\n### between.hi, between.lo\n\nthe top most string possible, and the lowest string possible. You must not be used\nas positions for items, because it will not be possible to insert items after\nor before them. These values represent the space infront of the first item, and the space between the last item.\n\n",
